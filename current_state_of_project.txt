Goal so far:
Construct a clean heterogeneous graph from the human Kinase_Substrate_Dataset with correct phosphosite modeling.

Implemented features:
Modular Python package structure (src/)
Graph construction from kinase–substrate data

Three node types:
kinase
protein
site

Two edge types:
protein → site (has_site)
kinase → site (phosphorylates)

Robust normalization of:
protein names
phosphosite strings (Ser/Thr/Tyr → S/T/Y)

Strict phosphosite naming rule:
sites are uniquely identified as PROTEIN-S###

Sanity checks to validate biological assumptions
Outputs written as compressed CSV for scalability

Validated assumptions (from sanity checks):
~10,000 unique phosphosite nodes
~1,800 site labels shared across multiple proteins (expected)
No duplicate phosphosites within the same protein

(Tentative) Next steps

From here, each step adds biological information without breaking what I’ve built.

Step 1: Add PTMsigDB (site–site pathway edges)

Why next:

Operates at the site level
Does not introduce new nodes
Enriches functional context

What it adds:
Edge type: site_same_pathway
Connects phosphosites participating in the same signaling pathway

Implementation style:
New file: src/builders/ptmsigdb.py
One extra call in main.py
No changes to existing logic

Step 2: Add MSigDB (protein–protein pathway edges)

Why:

Adds protein-level pathway context
Complements site-level pathways

Adds:
Edge type: protein_same_pathway

Step 3: Add protein–protein interactions (PPI)

Using:

high_confidence_score(in).csv
gene_protein(in).csv for Ensembl → gene mapping

Adds:
Edge type: protein_interacts_with_protein

Step 4 (optional, advanced): PTMcode2 co-evolution edges

Adds:
Site–site co-evolution relationships across proteins
Strong signal for functional coupling
